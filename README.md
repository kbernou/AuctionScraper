# Auction Scraper
A Python script that scrapes Auctionmaxx to tell you if there's something you want there.

I've since moved away, and it's a trek to get to the company to pick up goods. They've also undergone a significant site overhaul, and since I don't have much use for this anyway, I can't be bothered to update it.

## Requirements
* Python 3.7

## Future goals
* Alerts (IE after setting the script to run automatically, email you if it finds something)
